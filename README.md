# Yelp Dataset Challenge
## Improving Yelp ranking system

The Yelp website is a well-known platform on which users can have access to a whole range of information about local businesses in the US and recently across several countries. This information goes from the address of the business to its open hours, its customer reviews or its ranking. It also contains qualitative information such as presence of Wifi, possibility of take out, presence of parking and so on so forth. The current implementation of Yelp provides a grade out  of five stars for a business, which is computed averaging on the customerâ€™s grades. When a customer adds a review for a business, it also gives a grade for this business which is taken into account for the overall grade of the business. However, this overall grade for a business doesn't provide much information but the general approbation of customers about this business. Thus, the new feature we intend to provide in this project is to decompose this single grade into several grades related with a particular topic in which customers show interest. This new way of grading businesses will greatly help customers to have deeper insight and knowledge about businesses pros and cons. Eventually, this project will take advantage of state of the art machine learning and data mining algorithms in order to implement this new feature within the Yelp website, from the provided Yelp challenge dataset.
